Privacy Policy for OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit
Effective Date: October 26, 2023
Welcome to OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.
This policy applies to the OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit mobile application (the "App") provided by FutureTek Apps (referred to as "we", "us", or "our").
1. The Core Principle: Your Files are Your Files
The most important thing to know about OptiPDF is that we respect your privacy and the confidentiality of your documents.
All file processing is performed locally on your device. This includes scanning, optimizing, merging, and extracting pages from your PDF files and images.
Your documents, files, and images are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers. They remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to save, share, or export them.
We do not have access to the content of your files.
2. Information We Collect (And Why)
To provide and improve our services, we use industry-standard third-party services that collect a limited amount of anonymous or pseudonymous data.
a) Google AdMob (Advertising)
What it does: AdMob is Google's advertising service, which allows us to show ads in the App. This helps keep the App free for everyone.
Data Collected: AdMob collects device identifiers (like the Google Advertising ID), IP address, device information (such as model and operating system), and information about your interaction with the ads shown. This data is used to serve relevant, personalized ads and to prevent fraud.
Opt-Out: You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting your device's Google Settings under "Ads".
b) Google Firebase (Analytics & Crash Reporting)
What it does: We use Firebase to understand how our App is used and to fix crashes quickly.
Firebase Analytics: This service collects anonymous usage data, such as which features are used most often (e.g., "Scan" vs. "Merge"), session duration, and general user demographics (like country). This helps us understand what features are valuable and where we can make improvements. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.
Firebase Crashlytics: If the App crashes, this service automatically sends us an anonymous crash report. This report includes information about the device state at the time of the crash (like OS version and device model) and the code location that caused the error. This is essential for us to find and fix bugs. It does not collect any of your personal data or file content.
c) Google ML Kit Document Scanner
What it does: The "Scan" feature uses Google's ML Kit Document Scanner to provide high-quality scanning functionality.
Data Collected: This service performs all processing on-device. It analyzes the images from your camera or gallery to detect document edges, correct perspective, and apply filters. According to Google's policy, this data is not sent to Google's servers.
3. How We Use Information
To provide, maintain, and improve the App's functionality.
To display advertisements to support the App's development.
To understand usage patterns and fix bugs, crashes, and other issues.
To comply with legal obligations.
4. Data Security
We are committed to protecting your data. As all file processing is done locally on your device, the security of your documents is handled by your device's own operating system security. We do not transmit your files, and therefore we do not store them.
5. Data Sharing
We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of FutureTek Apps except in the following cases:
With Third-Party Service Providers: As described above, we share limited, non-personal, or pseudonymous data with our service providers (Google) for advertising, analytics, and crash reporting purposes. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies.
For Legal Reasons: We will share information if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.
6. User Consent (For Users in the EEA and UK)
If you are a user in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we are required to obtain your consent for the collection of data for personalized advertising. We use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to manage this consent process. You will be shown a consent dialog when you first use the App, and you can change your consent choices at any time through the app's settings.
7. Children's Privacy
Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete this from our servers immediately.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
