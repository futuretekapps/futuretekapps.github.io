    <h1>Privacy Policy for OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 4, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we handle, why, and how we use it.</p>

    <p>This policy applies to the OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit mobile application (the "App") provided by <strong>FutureTek Apps</strong> (referred to as "we", "us", or "our").</p>

    <h2>1. The Core Principle: Your Files are Your Files</h2>

    <p>The most important thing to know about OptiPDF is that we respect your privacy and the confidentiality of your documents.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All file processing is performed locally on your device.</strong> This includes scanning, optimizing, merging, and splitting your PDF files and images.</li>
        <li><strong>Your documents, files, and images are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.</strong> They remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to save, share, or export them.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to the content of your files.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- =================================================================== -->
    <!-- ========= START OF NEW SECTION FOR "MY DOCUMENTS" FEATURE ========= -->
    <!-- =================================================================== -->

    <h2>2. Local Data Storage (My Documents Feature)</h2>

    <p>To improve your experience, the App includes a "My Documents" feature that keeps a local record of the files you have processed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is stored:</strong> The App saves a reference to your processed files, including the file name, file size, creation timestamp, and the type of operation performed (e.g., "Optimized", "Merged").</li>
        <li><strong>Where it is stored:</strong> This information is stored **only on your device** in a local database.</li>
        <li><strong>No data is transmitted:</strong> No part of this list—including file names or metadata—is ever uploaded or shared with any server.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You have full control over this list. You can delete individual entries or clear the entire list at any time from within the App. Uninstalling the App will also remove this local database.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- =================================================================== -->
    <!-- ========================= END OF NEW SECTION ======================== -->
    <!-- =================================================================== -->

    <h2>3. Information We Collect (Third-Party Services)</h2>

    <p>To provide and improve our services, we use industry-standard third-party services that collect a limited amount of anonymous or pseudonymous data.</p>

    <h4>a) Google AdMob (Advertising)</h4>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> AdMob is Google's advertising service, which allows us to show ads in the App. This helps keep the App free for everyone.<br>
    <strong>Data Collected:</strong> AdMob may collect device identifiers (like the Google Advertising ID), IP address, and device information to serve relevant ads and to prevent fraud.<br>
    <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can manage your ad preferences in your device's Google Settings.</p>

    <h4>b) Google Firebase (Analytics & Crash Reporting)</h4>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> We use Firebase to understand how our App is used and to fix crashes quickly.<br>
    <strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> This service collects anonymous usage data, such as which features are used most often. This helps us improve the App. This data is aggregated and does not identify you personally.<br>
    <strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> If the App crashes, this service sends us an anonymous crash report with technical information about the crash. This is essential for us to find and fix bugs. It does not collect any of your personal data or file content.</p>

    <h4>c) Google ML Kit Document Scanner</h4>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The "Scan" feature uses Google's on-device machine learning kit to provide high-quality scanning functionality. According to Google's policy, this data is processed on-device and is not sent to Google's servers.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the App's functionality.</li>
        <li>To display advertisements to support the App's development.</li>
        <li>To analyze usage patterns and fix bugs and crashes.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security & Sharing</h2>
    <p>As all file processing and data storage (for the "My Documents" feature) occur locally on your device, the security of your documents is handled by your device's operating system. We do not transmit or store your files or document lists. We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals, except for the limited, anonymous data used by our third-party service providers (Google) as described above.</p>

    <h2>6. User Consent (For Users in the EEA and UK)</h2>
    <p>If you are a user in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we are required to obtain your consent for the collection of data for personalized advertising. We use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to manage this consent process. You can change your consent choices at any time through the app's settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app's "About" section. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:futuretekapps@gmail.com">futuretekapps@gmail.com</a></p>
