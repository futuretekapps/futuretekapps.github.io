<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
    <p><strong>Your Privacy comes first.</strong> TickDown is a paid, ad-free application designed to operate offline. Your personal data belongs to you and stays on your device.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Data Storage and Control</h2>
<p>TickDown follows a <strong>"Local First"</strong> architecture:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> All tasks, events, notes, and categories you create are stored in a local database on your device. We do not transmit this content to any external server.</li>
    <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You do not need to create an account or sign in to use the application. We do not have access to your email address or identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the application will permanently delete all local data associated with it, unless you have manually created a backup file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Permissions We Request</h2>
<p>To function correctly, TickDown requests specific permissions. We use these strictly for the app's core functionality:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):</strong> Used solely to deliver the reminders, countdown alerts, and daily summaries that you schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Alarms (USE_EXACT_ALARM / SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM):</strong> Used to ensure your reminders fire at the precise time you set, rather than being delayed by system battery optimization.</li>
  <li><strong>Calendar Access (READ_CALENDAR):</strong> <em>Optional.</em> If you enable "Show Device Calendars" in Settings, the app reads your device's calendar events to display them within the TickDown calendar view. This data is read in real-time for display purposes only and is <strong>not</strong> stored in our database or transmitted to us.</li>
  <li><strong>Boot Completed (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED):</strong> Used to automatically reschedule your reminders after you restart your phone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Analytics</h2>
<p>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (provided by Google) to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. This helps us identify crashes, fix bugs, and understand which features are popular.</p>
<p><strong>What we track:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>App performance (crash reports, app launch time).</li>
    <li>Generic interactions (e.g., "User created a task", "User changed theme").</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we DO NOT track:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>We <strong>never</strong> track the text content of your tasks or events (e.g., we know a task was created, but we do not know it was named "Buy Medication").</li>
    <li>We do not track your location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Backup & Restore</h2>
<p>The app includes a feature to export your data to a JSON file. This file is generated locally on your device.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are responsible for storing this backup file securely.</li>
    <li>If you share this file (e.g., via email or cloud storage), that transmission is subject to the privacy policies of the service you use to share it. TickDown does not see or access your backup files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. No Advertising</h2>
<p>TickDown is a paid application. We do not display third-party advertisements, nor do we sell your data to advertisers or data brokers.</p>

<h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>TickDown is not directed toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because the app works offline, parents can be assured that their child's data remains on the device.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

<div class="contact">
