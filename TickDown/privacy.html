    <h1>Privacy Policy for Tickdown</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 18, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using Tickdown! This privacy policy explains how our application ("Tickdown," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is incredibly important to us, and we've designed Tickdown to be as private as possible.</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>

    <p>Tickdown is designed to respect your privacy completely. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, share, or transmit any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <p>All the data you create within the app, including event names, dates, colors, and selected icons, is stored <strong>exclusively on your own device</strong>. This data never leaves your device and is never sent to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Storage Only</h2>

    <p>The core functionality of Tickdown relies on storing your event data in a local database on your device. This data is entirely under your control. If you uninstall the Tickdown app, this local data will be permanently deleted from your device as part of the standard operating system process.</p>

    <h2>3. Backup & Restore Feature</h2>

    <p>Tickdown offers a Backup & Restore feature that allows you to export your event data to a file (e.g., <code>tickdown_backup.json</code>). This process is entirely initiated and controlled by you.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> When you choose to back up your data, the app creates a file containing your event information and uses your device's standard file-saving interface for you to choose where to save it (e.g., on your device, in Google Drive, etc.). We do not have access to this file or its contents.</li>
        <li><strong>Restore:</strong> When you choose to restore from a backup, the app uses your device's standard file-picker interface for you to select a file. The app reads the data from the file you select to import the events. This file is read locally and is not uploaded to any server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The security and storage of your backup files are your own responsibility.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>

    <p>Tickdown may request the following permissions to provide its full functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you alerts when your countdowns are complete. You can manage this permission at any time in your device's system settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The app does <strong>not</strong> require permissions for internet access, contacts, location, or any other sensitive personal data.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Our app is intended for a general audience.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
