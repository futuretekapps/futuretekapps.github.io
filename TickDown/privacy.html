<h1>Privacy Policy for TickDown</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

<p>Thank you for using TickDown! This Privacy Policy describes how our application (“TickDown,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) handles your information. We value your privacy and design TickDown to work primarily offline with full local data control.</p>

<h2>1. The Core Principle: Your Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
<p>TickDown does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any server. All events, tasks, reminders, and related information you create are stored only on your device. We never access or share your data.</p>

<h2>2. Information You Provide</h2>
<p>The app stores information you create (e.g., event titles, task details, categories) locally on your phone or tablet. None of this data is uploaded or synced to any external service unless you choose to back it up manually.</p>

<h2>3. Anonymous Analytics for App Improvement</h2>
<p>TickDown uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (by Google) to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data that helps improve app performance and stability. This data includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature usage statistics (e.g., how often reminders are scheduled)</li>
  <li>Crash reports and performance diagnostics</li>
  <li>App open frequency and version information</li>
</ul>

<p>Firebase Analytics may use the <strong>Advertising ID</strong> of your device solely for analytical purposes (to count unique app installs and active users). TickDown does <strong>not</strong> use this ID for advertising, targeting, or marketing. All analytics data is anonymous and not linked to any personal identity.</p>

<h2>4. Local Storage and Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Your app data is stored locally. Uninstalling TickDown automatically deletes this data. You can also manually delete your backup files at any time.</p>

<h2>5. Backup & Restore</h2>
<p>TickDown’s optional Backup & Restore feature lets you export and import your data manually. These backups remain entirely under your control and are not uploaded anywhere by the app.</p>

<h2>6. Permissions We Request</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> To deliver reminders and alerts.</li>
  <li><strong>USE_EXACT_ALARM:</strong> To ensure precise scheduling of events and countdowns.</li>
  <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:</strong> To restore reminders after a device restart.</li>
</ul>
<p>No other sensitive permissions (camera, contacts, location, etc.) are requested.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>TickDown is not directed toward children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy occasionally. Any updates will appear on this page with a new effective date.</p>
