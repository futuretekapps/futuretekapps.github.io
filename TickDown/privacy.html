    <h1>Privacy Policy for TickDown</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Set Current Date, e.g., November 5, 2025]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using TickDown! This privacy policy explains how our application ("TickDown," "we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is incredibly important to us, and we've designed TickDown to be as private and secure as possible.</p>

    <h2>1. The Core Principle: Your Data is Yours</h2>

    <p>TickDown operates on a simple and powerful principle: **we do not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data.**</p>

    <p>All the data you create within the app—including event countdowns, task lists, subtasks, categories, notes, and reminders—is stored **exclusively in a local database on your own device**. This data never leaves your device and is never sent to our servers or any third-party services. We have no access to your entries.</p>

    <h2>2. Information You Provide</h2>

    <p>The information handled by TickDown is limited to the content you create. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Event names, dates, colors, and icons for your countdowns.</li>
        <li><strong>Tasks & Subtasks:</strong> Task titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, and any subtasks you create.</li>
        <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Custom categories you create to organize your events and tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is treated as your private data and remains on your device under your control.</p>

    <h2>3. Local Storage and Data Deletion</h2>

    <p>The core functionality of TickDown relies on storing your data locally. If you uninstall the TickDown app, this local database and all its contents will be permanently deleted from your device as part of the standard operating system process.</p>

    <h2>4. Backup & Restore Feature</h2>

    <p>TickDown offers a local Backup & Restore feature that allows you to export your app data to a single file (e.g., <code>tickdown_backup.json</code>). This process is entirely initiated and controlled by you.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> When you choose to back up your data, the app creates a file containing all your events, tasks, subtasks, and categories. It then uses your device's standard file-saving interface for you to choose where to save it. We do not have access to this file or its location.</li>
        <li><strong>Restore:</strong> When you choose to restore from a backup, the app uses your device's standard file-picker for you to select a backup file. The app reads the data from the file you select and replaces all existing data in the app. This process is performed entirely locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The security, storage, and transfer of your backup files are your own responsibility.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions Requested</h2>

    <p>TickDown requests a minimal set of permissions solely to enable its core features. We do not request permissions for internet access, contacts, location, or other sensitive data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications (<code>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code>):</strong> Required to send you time-sensitive alerts for your event countdowns and task reminders. You can manage this permission at any time in your device's system settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Exact Alarms (<code>USE_EXACT_ALARM</code>):</strong> Required to ensure your event countdowns and task reminders are delivered precisely on time, as users expect from a planner and calendar app. This permission is automatically granted on install and does not allow us to read your calendar or other personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Run at startup (<code>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</code>):</strong> Required to automatically reschedule your notifications after your device reboots. If this permission is not granted, your reminders will not survive a device restart until you open the app again.</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Services (<code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC</code>):</strong> Used by Android's WorkManager to ensure that your home screen widgets update reliably and immediately after you make a change in the app. This is a technical requirement for on-device data synchronization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). Our app is intended for a general audience.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app's features or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
