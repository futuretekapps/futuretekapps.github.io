    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>TickDown is a mobile application designed for creating event countdowns and managing personal tasks. The Service is provided as an offline-first tool, meaning all data you create is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, FOR THE SERVICE.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
