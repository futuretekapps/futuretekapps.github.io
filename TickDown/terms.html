<h1>Terms and Conditions for TickDown</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

<div class="disclaimer">
    <p><strong>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the TickDown mobile application (the "Service") operated by FutureTek Apps ("we", "us", or "our").</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By downloading, installing, or using TickDown, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>TickDown is a personal productivity app designed for creating countdowns, tasks, and reminders. The Service operates primarily offline, and all user-created data is stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>3. License Grant</h2>
<p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use TickDown for personal, non-commercial purposes on any compatible device you own or control.</p>

<h2>4. Your Data and Responsibility</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> All content you create (events, tasks, categories, notes) is stored only on your device. We do not store or access your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> Because your data is stored locally, we cannot recover it if your device is lost, damaged, or if the app is uninstalled.</li>
    <li><strong>Backup & Restore:</strong> TickDown allows manual backup to a file. You are responsible for storing, securing, and restoring these files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Analytics and Performance Monitoring</h2>
<p>TickDown uses <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous, aggregated data to improve app performance, stability, and user experience. This data includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Crash reports and technical diagnostics</li>
    <li>General feature usage statistics</li>
    <li>Session counts and version information</li>
</ul>

<p>Firebase Analytics may access the device’s <strong>Advertising ID</strong> solely to measure anonymous user activity (not for ads or personalized tracking). TickDown does <strong>not</strong> display ads, use targeted marketing, or share data with advertisers.</p>

<h2>6. User Conduct and Restrictions</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer, modify, or redistribute the application</li>
    <li>Use the app for illegal or unauthorized activities</li>
    <li>Remove or alter copyright or branding elements</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The TickDown app, including code, design, and branding, is the property of FutureTek Apps and protected by copyright laws. Your user-generated content remains your property.</p>

<h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>TickDown is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” We make no warranties regarding performance, availability, or error-free operation.</p>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, FutureTek Apps shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data loss, device damage, or inability to use the Service.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the app immediately ends.</p>

<h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms occasionally. Updates will be reflected on this page with a new Effective Date. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), unless otherwise required by local law where you reside.</p>
