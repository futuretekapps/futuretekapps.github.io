<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 13, 2025</p>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <p><strong>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before downloading or using the TickDown mobile application (the "Service") operated by FutureTek Apps ("we", "us", or "our").</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using TickDown, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not authorized to use the Service.</p>

<h2>2. Nature of the App (Paid Service)</h2>
<p>TickDown is a paid application available for purchase via the Google Play Store. </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>One-Time Purchase:</strong> The download fee grants you access to the app's features as described at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li><strong>No Recurring Fees:</strong> Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the app (e.g., for optional future subscriptions), there are no recurring monthly charges.</li>
    <li><strong>Transactions & Refunds:</strong> All financial transactions, including purchases and refund requests, are handled exclusively by the Google Play Store in accordance with their Terms of Service and Refund Policy. We do not process payments or retain your credit card information directly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. License Grant</h2>
<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download and use a copy of the application on a mobile device that you own or control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

<h2>4. User Data and Backup Responsibility</h2>
<p>TickDown operates primarily as an offline, local-first application.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your events, tasks, categories, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this content to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk of Data Loss:</strong> You acknowledge that if your device is lost, damaged, reset, or if the app is uninstalled, your data will be permanently lost unless you have created a backup.</li>
    <li><strong>Backup Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for creating regular backups using the app's "Backup & Restore" feature and saving those files to a secure location (such as Google Drive or another external storage). We are not liable for any loss of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Critical Disclaimer Regarding Notifications</h2>
<p>TickDown relies on the Android operating system to deliver scheduled notifications and alarms.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> You acknowledge that factors outside our control—including but not limited to device battery optimization settings, "Do Not Disturb" modes, manufacturer-specific background process killing, or OS updates—may prevent notifications from firing.</li>
    <li><strong>Not for Critical Safety:</strong> You agree <strong>not</strong> to rely on TickDown for critical situations where the failure of a reminder could result in physical harm, financial loss, or significant injury (e.g., medical reminders or flight departures).</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Analytics and Privacy</h2>
<p>We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the app stability. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally or view the specific content of your tasks.</p>
<p>For full details, please refer to our <a href="https://futuretekapps.github.io/TickDown/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<div class="caps">
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, FUTURETEK APPS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    <p>WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT IT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
</div>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<div class="caps">
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL FUTURETEK APPS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DATA LOSS, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.</p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE APPLICATION.</p>
</div>

<h2>9. Updates and Changes</h2>
<p>We may provide updates, patches, or new versions of the app at our discretion. We do not guarantee that the app will be supported indefinitely or that it will function on all future versions of the Android operating system.</p>

<h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
