    <h1>Privacy Policy for ColorBee</h1>
    <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 26, 2023</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing ColorBee! Your privacy, and especially your child's privacy, is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it. We've designed this policy to be easy for parents to read and understand.</p>

    <h2>In Simple Terms: A Quick Summary</h2>
    <p>We designed ColorBee to be a safe and fun environment for children.</p>
    
    <table class="summary-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>What We Collect</th>
                <th>Why We Collect It</th>
                <th>Who We Share It With</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Nothing from your child.</strong> The app does not ask for or collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like names, emails, or photos from your child. Drawings are saved only on your device.</td>
                <td>N/A</td>
                <td>No one.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Anonymous Usage Data</strong> (e.g., which coloring pages are popular, how long the app is used).</td>
                <td>To understand which features are most loved and to improve the app for everyone. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you or your child.</td>
                <td><strong>Google (Firebase Analytics)</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Anonymous Crash Data</strong> (e.g., device type, operating system version when a crash occurs).</td>
                <td>To find and fix bugs, crashes, and performance issues, making the app more stable and reliable.</td>
                <td><strong>Google (Firebase Crashlytics)</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Transaction Information</strong> for the "Unlock All" purchase.</td>
                <td>To process your payment securely and to restore your purchase on other devices. We <strong>do not</strong> see or store your payment details.</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Most Importantly:</strong> We have explicitly disabled the collection of the Advertising ID. This means we do not track your child across apps for advertising purposes. Our app contains <strong>no advertisements.</strong></p>

    <h2>Full Privacy Policy</h2>

    <h3>1. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K)</h3>
    <p>ColorBee is intended for children. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including its provisions for children (GDPR-K).</p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your region). The app's core experience is fully accessible without providing any personal data. In-app purchases are protected by a parental gate to ensure they are made by an adult.</p>

    <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We collect a minimal amount of non-personal information to operate and improve our app.</p>
    
    <h4>a) Information We Do NOT Collect:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or physical addresses.</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or audio recordings.</li>
        <li>Precise location data.</li>
        <li>Contact lists or other sensitive device data.</li>
        <li>The Advertising ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>b) Information We Collect Automatically (Non-Personal):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage and Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect aggregated, anonymous data about how users interact with our app. This includes information such as session duration, screens viewed, features used (e.g., which coloring tools are selected), and general device information (e.g., device model, OS version). This data is completely anonymous and helps us improve the app's design and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Crash and Performance Data:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect anonymous information about crashes and performance issues. This helps us diagnose and fix bugs quickly. The data collected includes stack traces, device state at the time of the crash, and other technical information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the non-personal information we collect for the sole purpose of improving the ColorBee experience. Specifically, we use it to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Operate, maintain, and improve our app's features and functionality.</li>
        <li>Diagnose and resolve technical problems and crashes.</li>
        <li>Understand user engagement to make better decisions about future updates and new content.</li>
        <li>Fulfill and manage in-app purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use this information for advertising or marketing purposes. <strong>We do not sell your data.</strong></p>

    <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We rely on trusted third-party services to provide core functionality. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> All in-app purchases are processed securely by Google through their Play Billing Library. We do not have access to or store any of your payment information, such as credit card details.
            <br><a href="https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=privacynotice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Payments Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Firebase (a Google service):</strong> We use Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. As stated, we have configured these services in a privacy-focused way suitable for a children's app, including disabling Advertising ID collection.
            <br><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Privacy and Security Information</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Your Rights as a Parent</h3>
    <p>You have the right to review and request the deletion of any data associated with your device. Since we only collect anonymous, aggregated data, it is not personally identifiable. However, if you have any concerns, you can reset the analytics instance by clearing the app's data in your device's settings. For questions about your purchase history, you should contact Google Play support directly.</p>

    <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
    <p>We take reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, and misuse. All data transmitted to our third-party services is encrypted.</p>

    <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h3>8. Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
