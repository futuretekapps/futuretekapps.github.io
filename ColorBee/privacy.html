Privacy Policy for ColorBee (Kids Coloring App)

At Colorish, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information and ensure a safe experience for kids and parents alike.

No Personal Information Collected We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from children or users. The app is designed specifically for young children and does not require login, sign-up, or any personal details.

In-App Purchases The app includes a single in-app purchase to unlock all coloring pages. This purchase is handled securely through Google Play Billing. We do not store or access any payment information.

Parental gates are used to restrict purchase access to adults only.

Analytics We use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage (like how many times a page is opened), but no personally identifiable information is collected. This helps us improve the app experience without compromising your privacy.

No Ads Our app does not show any third-party ads, ensuring a safe and distraction-free environment for kids.

Children’s Privacy We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Google Play Families Policy. The app is made for children under 13 and uses protective features such as:

No external links without a parental gate

No social media integrations

No online connectivity
