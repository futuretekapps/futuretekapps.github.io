<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 3, 2025</p>

<div class="disclaimer-box">
    <p><strong>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the TickDown Lite mobile application (the "Service") operated by FutureTek Apps ("we", "us", or "our").</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By downloading, installing, or using TickDown Lite, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

<h2>2. Nature of the App (Freemium Service)</h2>
<p>TickDown Lite is a "freemium" application, meaning it offers both free and premium features.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> The free version of the app contains advertisements and has a functional limit on the number of active tasks and events you can create.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewarded Ads:</strong> You may have the option to watch a rewarded video advertisement to temporarily unlock additional capacity. This unlock is time-limited as described in the app.</li>
    <li><strong>In-App Purchase (IAP):</strong> You can make a one-time purchase ("Premium Unlock") to permanently remove all advertisements and unlock unlimited functionality. All financial transactions are handled by the Google Play Store.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. License Grant</h2>
<p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use TickDown Lite for your personal, non-commercial use on a compatible device you own or control.</p>

<h2>4. User Data and Backup Responsibility</h2>
<p>TickDown Lite operates as an offline, local-first application.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your events, tasks, and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not transmit this content to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk of Data Loss:</strong> You acknowledge that if your device is lost or the app is uninstalled, your data will be permanently lost unless you have created a backup.</li>
    <li><strong>Backup Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for creating and securing backups using the app's "Backup & Restore" feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Critical Disclaimer Regarding Notifications</h2>
<p>TickDown Lite relies on the Android operating system to deliver scheduled notifications.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> You acknowledge that factors outside our control—such as device battery optimization settings, "Do Not Disturb" modes, or manufacturer-specific background restrictions—may prevent or delay notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Not for Critical Safety:</strong> You agree <strong>not</strong> to rely on TickDown Lite for critical situations where the failure of a reminder could result in physical harm, financial loss, or significant injury.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Analytics and Privacy</h2>
<p>We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to improve the app. We do not track the content of your tasks or events. For full details on our data practices, please refer to our <a href="https://futuretekapps.github.io/TickDown/privacy_lite.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<div class="caps">
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. FUTURETEK APPS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
</div>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<div class="caps">
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL FUTURETEK APPS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DATA LOSS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.</p>
    <p>FOR USERS WHO HAVE PURCHASED THE PREMIUM UNLOCK, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE IN-APP PURCHASE. FOR FREE USERS, OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
</div>

<h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
