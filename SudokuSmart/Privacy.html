    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>Our App is designed to be a fun and engaging experience without requiring personal identification. We collect a limited amount of non-personally identifiable information to improve our services and provide a better user experience.</p>

    <h3>b. Data Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Progress and Statistics:</strong> To provide features like "Continue Game," "Daily Challenge," and personal statistics (e.g., win rate, best times, streaks), we store your game data locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to us and remains on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and Analytics Data:</strong> We use third-party services to automatically collect anonymous data about how you interact with our App. This may include:
            <ul>
                <li>Device Information (e.g., device model, operating system version).</li>
                <li>In-game events (e.g., starting a new game, using a hint, completing a puzzle).</li>
                <li>Crash reports and performance data to help us identify and fix bugs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Data:</strong> To support our App, we show advertisements. Our advertising partners may collect information to provide personalized ads. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's Advertising ID.</li>
                <li>Location information (at a general, non-precise level).</li>
                <li>Information about ads you have seen or interacted with.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>The information we collect is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Operate and Improve the App:</strong> We use analytics and crash reports to understand how our App is used, identify bugs, and make improvements to features and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain Core Features:</strong> Local data storage is essential for features like saving game progress and tracking your personal best scores.</li>
        <li><strong>To Provide Advertising:</strong> We use this information to display relevant advertisements, which helps keep the App free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>We rely on trusted third-party services to operate our App. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Our advertising partner. Used to display banner, interstitial, and rewarded video ads.

    <p>You can control the collection of some information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalized Advertising:</strong> You can opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting the settings on your Android device. Go to <code>Settings > Google > Ads</code> and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization." This will not stop ads from appearing, but they will be less relevant to your interests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
