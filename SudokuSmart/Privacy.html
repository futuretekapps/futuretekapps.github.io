    <h1>Privacy Policy for OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application OptiPDF – Smart PDF Toolkit ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>FutureTek Apps</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Core Privacy Principle: Your Files are Your Files</h2>
    <p>We believe your documents are private and should remain so. The core functionality of OptiPDF is designed with this principle in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All file processing is performed locally on your device.</strong> This includes scanning, optimizing, merging, and splitting your PDF files and images.</li>
        <li><strong>Your documents, files, and images are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.</strong> They remain on your device unless you explicitly choose to save, share, or export them.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to the content of your files. Any processed files are stored locally on your device in a private directory managed by the Application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>To improve performance, fix bugs, and support the Application with advertising, we use standard third-party services that may collect certain information automatically. This includes, but is not limited to, your device's advertising ID, IP address, device type and operating system, and anonymized information about how you use the Application (e.g., which features are used most often).</p>

    <p>Specifically, we use the following third-party services:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob & Mediation Partners (e.g., ironSource from Unity):</strong> Our Application uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, which helps keep the app free. AdMob may use mediation to include other ad networks like ironSource.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> If you grant consent (for users in the EEA/UK), these services may use your device's advertising ID to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Personalized Ads:</strong> If you do not grant consent, you will still see ads, but they will be based on contextual information (like the app's category) rather than your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            You can change your consent choices at any time within the Application's settings. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our partners:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Ad Technology Policy</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.ironsrc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Unity-Ads-Privacy-Policy-2.1.24.pdf" target="_blank">ironSource (from Unity) Ads Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> We use this service to understand how users interact with OptiPDF. It collects anonymous, aggregated data, such as which PDF tools are most popular. This helps us prioritize new features and improve the user experience. This data does not personally identify you.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To ensure the Application is stable and reliable, we use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect anonymous crash reports. If the app crashes, this service sends us technical information about the device and the crash, which we use solely for diagnosing and fixing bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google ML Kit Document Scanner:</strong> The "Scan to PDF" feature uses Google's on-device machine learning kit. According to Google's policy, all image processing for this feature occurs locally on your device and is not sent to Google's servers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Consent (For Users in the EEA and UK)</h2>
    <p>For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, we are required by law to obtain your consent for the collection of data for personalized advertising. We use Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP) to present you with choices about your data. You can review and change your consent preferences at any time from within the Application's settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Since all of your documents and files are processed and stored locally on your device, their security is handled by your device's own security systems. For the automatically collected anonymous data, our third-party service providers (Google, Unity/ironSource) provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect this information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact us at <strong>[Your Email Address]</strong>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Application and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at <strong>[Your Email Address]</strong>.</p>
