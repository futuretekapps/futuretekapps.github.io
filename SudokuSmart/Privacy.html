    <h1>Privacy Policy for SudokuSmart</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 25, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application SudokuSmart ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by the developer account <strong>FutureTek Apps</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    
    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>The Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID), the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the Application. This data is collected to provide core app functionality, serve advertisements, and improve the user experience.</p>

    <p>We use the following third-party services that collect and process this data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob & Google User Messaging Platform (UMP):</strong> Our application uses Google AdMob to display advertisements, which helps keep the app free. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and other applicable regions, we use Google's UMP to gather consent for ad serving in compliance with GDPR.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> If you grant consent, AdMob may use your advertising ID to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Personalized Ads:</strong> If you do not grant consent, you will still see ads, but they will be contextual (based on the app's content, like "puzzle game") and not based on your personal activity.</li>
            </ul>
            You can change your consent preferences at any time from the "Privacy" section within the app's settings. For more information, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Ad Technology Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase:</strong> We use this service to understand how our users engage with the Application. It helps us track anonymized and aggregated data such as which features are most popular, game completion statistics (like difficulty and time taken), and overall user activity. This data does not personally identify you and is used solely to improve the Application and fix bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To improve the stability of our Application, we use Firebase Crashlytics to automatically collect crash reports. When the app crashes, this service collects information about the device state, app version, and the code that caused the crash. This information is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable information. It is used exclusively for diagnosing and fixing bugs.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Provided Information</h2>
    <p>The Application does not require user registration and does not collect any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, email address, address, or phone number. All game progress, statistics, settings, and achievements are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>
    
    <h2>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</h2>
    <p>This Application does not collect, use, or share precise information about the real-time location of your mobile device.</p>

    <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
    <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services as described above to help us improve the Application and its services. We will not share your information with third parties except in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

    <p>We may disclose Automatically Collected Information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>
        <li>with our trusted services providers (Google) who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We retain automatically collected, anonymized data for up to 26 months as per standard Google Analytics retention policies. All personal game data, such as your statistics and achievements, is stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the Application, this local data will be removed.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13, or the relevant age of consent in other jurisdictions. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact us at <strong>futuretekapps@gmail.com</strong>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Data transmitted to our service providers is done over secure (HTTPS) connections. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing” means using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining, and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the United States your information will be transferred, processed, and stored there under United States privacy standards.</p>
